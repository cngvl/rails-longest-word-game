# README

This is another one of the apps that I made as a part of my Le Wagon experience which helped familiarise myself with hosting and implementing ruby embedded code. The task was to recreate an app so that the user could play a game similar to 'Countdown', where the user is given a selection of letters and should try create the longest word using the letters given.<br>
The app uses a basic API to check whether the user input is an English word, and also checks if the input is made of letters from the selection provided.
